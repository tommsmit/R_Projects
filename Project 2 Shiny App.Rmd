## Let's try some shall we?

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Female Vs Male Dropouts by Grade (7-12) from 1998-2019"),

    # Sidebar layout
    sidebarLayout(

        sidebarPanel(

        )
    )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
      ggplot(total1, aes_string(x=input$x, y=input$y,col=input$z)) + geom_jitter() #Notice the difference between the ggplots
    })
}

# Run the application
