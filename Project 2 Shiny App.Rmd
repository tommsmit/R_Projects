## Project Overview

For my second project, I wanted to explore dropout rates in Texas public schools. As a former high school math teacher, I worked with countless students, each with their own background, heritage and labels. A lot of those students struggled in high school, but luckily very few of them dropped out. 

According to Texas Education Agency (TEA), there are a multitude of reasons for dropping out of high school. Here are some common reasons:

- Poor attendance (attrition)
- Entered into alternative GED (non-diploma) program
- Not enough credits earned
- Didn't pass Standardized Exams (STAAR)
- Age being above the maximum limit
- Expulsion
- Incarceration
- Being homeless
- Deceased 

I decided to focus on three main factors: Grade level, Race/Ethnicity, and student characteristics.

Student characteristics include: Special Education, 504, Gifted and Talented (GT), At Risk, English Language Learner (ELL), dyslexic, ect.

I scraped data from [TEA's Website](https://tea.texas.gov/) from 1998-2019 and analyzed the data. Here are my results.
